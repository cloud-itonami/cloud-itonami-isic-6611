  "The safety kernel's executable spec, three ways:

  1. battery lock — the kernel's own in-subset battery must pass
     case-for-case (`battery-case-count` == `(battery-pass-count)`),
     so a silently dropped case can't survive review.
  2. parity matrix — the kernel's phase core is compared against an
     independent reference copy of the ORIGINAL set-based cond logic
     over the FULL input space (all phases incl. out-of-range, all op
     codes incl. the reserved read code and unknown, all governor
     dispositions). The façade delegates, so this is the guard that
     delegation didn't change semantics.
  3. governor boundary — the confidence floor boundary, the
     fail-closed treatment of out-of-range confidence, and the
     kernel/registry parity of the minimum-market-cap listing
     standard, exercised through the real `marketadmin.governor/check`
     façade and the registry constant."
